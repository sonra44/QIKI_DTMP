# ADR Index (QIKI_DTMP)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

Rules:

- An ADR is **decision-only**: context → decision → consequences.
- ADRs must be stable and referenced from relevant canon docs.
- If a document proposes a conflicting approach, the ADR must explain **why** we choose one over the other.
